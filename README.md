# Introduction

The Ozura Asset payment processor allows a merchant to leverage blockchain technology in combination with traditional card payments. This entire process is automated by this processor and provides merchants with the ability to access it via a REST API solution.

**The process has two steps: getting a** [**processing fee quote**](broken-reference) **and** [**authorizing a transaction for that quote**](broken-reference)**. Quotes are only active for 10 minutes following their creation. The API solution consists of three merchant-accessible requests.**
